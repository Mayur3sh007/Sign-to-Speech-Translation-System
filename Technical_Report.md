## Abstract

This technical report documents a real-time Sign-to-Speech translation system developed during [Hackathon Name]. The system converts Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into synthesized speech using computer vision and deep learning techniques. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) for gesture recognition and integrating natural language processing (NLP) for context-aware sentence formation, the system provides an accessible communication bridge between the speech and hearing-impaired community and the general population. The project demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in creating inclusive communication solutions with practical applications in educational, healthcare, and social environments.

## 1. Introduction

Sign language is the primary mode of communication for approximately 70 million deaf people worldwide. However, communication barriers persist as the majority of the hearing population lacks fluency in sign language. This technical gap creates social isolation and limits access to essential services for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

This project addresses this challenge through a technology-based solution that enables effective, real-time communication through automation. By converting sign language gestures into speech, the system enables deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to communicate more easily with those who don't understand sign language.

**Note:** This technical report documents a specific feature I personally developed as part of a larger accessibility platform created by our team at Hacknova 3.0. While the broader platform included additional accessibility features, this sign-to-speech translation system was my individual contribution.

## 2. Related Work

Several approaches have been explored to bridge this communication gap:

- **Static image-based classifiers:** Previous solutions often relied on analyzing static images, limiting real-time capabilities.
- **Sensor-based gloves:** While effective, these solutions require specialized hardware that increases cost and reduces accessibility.
- **Video-based systems:** More recent approaches use video input but often struggle with real-time performance or have limited vocabulary.

Our system improves upon these approaches by using a camera-only input method and employing CNN-based recognition to ensure affordability and real-time performance.

## 3. System Architecture

The system architecture consists of four primary modules:

### 3.1 Data Acquisition
- Captures live video feed using a standard webcam
- Processes real-time video input for hand tracking
- Integrates with video call functionality using ngrok for remote communication

### 3.2 Gesture Recognition
- Implements MediaPipe hand tracking framework for accurate hand pose estimation
- Detects and tracks hand landmarks in real-time
- Uses custom gesture recognition logic based on MediaPipe outputs

### 3.3 Sentence Formation
- Implements custom hand-based controls for intuitive sentence construction
- Allows users to build complete sentences through a series of gestures
- Provides visual feedback during sentence formation

### 3.4 Multilingual Speech Generation
- Converts the formed sentences into natural-sounding speech using Eleven Labs API
- Integrates with Gemini API for multilingual translation capabilities
- Supports cross-language communication between users of different native languages

## 4. Implementation Details

**Solution:** Implemented ngrok tunneling to simulate video call environments effectively.

## 6. Results and Achievement

The system was evaluated during the Hacknova 3.0 hackathon and achieved:
- First place recognition among all competing projects
- Successful demonstration of real-time sign-to-speech translation
- Positive feedback from judges on innovation and social impact
- Functional prototype within the 24-48 hour hackathon timeframe

## 7. Integration Within Larger Platform

This Sign-to-Speech translation system was developed as a key component of a more comprehensive accessibility platform created by our team at Hacknova 3.0. The larger platform includes additional features for deaf and speech-impaired users, with this particular sign language translation system being my primary individual contribution to the project.

The complete platform integrates multiple accessibility tools:
- The Sign-to-Speech translation system (my individual contribution)
- Additional accessibility features developed by other team members
- A unified interface connecting all components

The first-place win at Hacknova 3.0 recognized the combined innovation of all platform components working together to address accessibility challenges.

## 8. Future Development

Several enhancements are planned for future iterations:
- Expand the gesture dataset to include more complex phrases and sentences
- Integrate voice-to-sign functionality for bidirectional communication
- Develop a mobile application for wider accessibility
- Implement continuous learning to improve accuracy over time

## 9. Conclusion

This Sign-to-Speech system demonstrates how deep learning and computer vision can drive inclusive communication solutions. By enabling real-time translation of sign language to speech, the system has the potential to significantly improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. The first-place win at [Hackathon Name] validates the innovation and potential impact of this solution.
